emu-upmaa-multimedia-import
===========================
Used to create and link multimedia records in KE EMu.  Uses emu-upmaa-api for interacting with the KE provided api. This can be used to link multimedia records to any other module in EMu. See default.properties for sample configurations. 

As EMu is custom for each client this will probably require some customization to work with your implementation but I have tried to make this as flexible as possible. 


Requirements
===
The emu-upmaa-api available here: https://github.com/moltude/emu-upmaa-api. The imu.properties file should be placed in ./conf/
